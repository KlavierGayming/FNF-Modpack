:o:**when he arrived, he decided to open an old school notebook on the topshelf, filled with doodles from middle school**
:o:**(Ya know, to look at how much they've improved as an artist over the years)**
:o:**As he flipped through the pages, noticable doodles gave the creator a sense of nostalgia**
:o:**After feeling this, the creator wanted to draw what he always used to draw in middle school**
:o:**His favorite stick figure, Sketchy**
:o:**The creator grabbed a pen and a pencil and made huge line strokes with his arm**
:o:**And, after a few pencil strokes, some shading, and then finishing it off with the line art...**
